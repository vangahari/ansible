** Ansible playbooks are text files or configuration files that are written in a format called YAML 

YAML mainly written in key value pair separated by a colon

Example:
Fruit: apple 
Vegetable: Carrot
Animal: Lion
Meat: Mutton


Array/Lists
Fruits:
    - Apple
    - Banana
    - Orange
    - Mango
Animals:
    - Lion
    - Tiger
    - Elephant 
    - Zebra

Dictionary/map
    Banana: 
        Calaries: 105
        Fat: 0.4g
        Carbs: 27g

Key value / Dictionary/ Lists 

Fruits:
    - Banana: 
        Calaries: 105
        Fat: 0.4g
        Carbs: 27g
    - Grape: 
        Calaries: 62
        Fat: 0.3g
        Carbs: 26g


Key notes to keep in mind:
1) Dictionaries are not ordered 
    eg: - Banana: 
            Calaries: 105
            Fat: 0.4g
            Carbs: 27g
        - Grape: 
            Calaries: 62
            Carbs: 26g
            Fat: 0.3g
Like if you see above the the order is not required, even if you change the properties in terms of order it doesnt matter but it still the same

2) Lists / Array are order.
