## Ansible work with multiple servers in your infrastructure at the same time. In order to work with multiple machines ansbile needs to establish the connectivity to those servers. This is done with SSH for linux, powershell remoting for Windows. Thats what ansible makes agentless 

## Now the information about the target systems will be stored in a file called inventory file which will be available in the path "/etc/ansible/hosts"

## If you dont create any ansible inventory file, ansible by default uses this file which is located in "/etc/ansible/hosts"

## Sample inventory file 

server1.company.com
server2.company.com

## You can also different servers to geather like below 
[web]
server3.company.com
server4.company.com

[db]
server5.company.com
server6.company.com

## You can also togeather the groups of groups like below
[all_servers:children]
web
db 

## More examples.
# I have list of servers named 1,2...4
server1.company.com
server2.company.com
server3.company.com
server4.company.com

## However I would like to call using alias in ansible. I could add host parameter and alias in the beginning of the line like below

web1 ansible_host=server1.company.com
web2 ansible_host=server2.company.com
db1 ansible_host=server3.company.com
db2 ansible_host=server4.company.com

## Note: ansible_host is the inventory parameter, that you can specify the FQDN or IP address for the target 

Other Inventoy parameters are:
    - ansible_connection - ssh/winrm/localhost - Which type of connection ansible is going to use to connect to target server
    - ansible_port - 22/5986 - Which port ansible is going to use to connect to target server
    - ansible_user - root/admin/centos/ubuntu - what user ansible is going to use to connect to target server
    - ansible_ssh_pass Password - What Password ansible is going to use to connect to target server
